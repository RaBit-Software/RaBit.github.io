						<p>	In 2011, Nick and Jenna met at Youngstown State University. It was love at first sight. Before these cameras were popular, Nick purchased a Nikon D5000.
							Nick began taking photographs of various subjects, including Jenna being pregnant with their first-born son, Nick’s 1994 flaming red Camaro, and nature
							and wildlife. Jenna immediately recognized Nick’s special, immeasurable photography and videography skills. Both Nick and Jenna went on to obtain
							bachelor’s degrees and post-graduate degrees, but their passion for photography, videography, and creating art remained unhindered. As they say,
							“You cannot put a price on passion.“ Nicolas Melia photography was born out of a need for a creative outlet. We pride ourselves in giving individuals
							and families the opportunity to see themselves from our lens, for the beautiful and wonderful people that they are.
